== How to write effective documentation
This document outlines some tips and guidelines on writing effective and useful documenation for end users. 

## Why do we need documentation at all?	

Documentation is part of the product, is shipped with the product, visible in the repos, thus making it as important as the code.
Documentation should tell users **how** to do what they need to do. It also needs to tell them **what** it does, how it works, and **why** they should use it and **when** they should use it.
